  <b>STAGE 0 SUMMARY</b><br><br><b>Major Pieces of the Web</b><br><p>The web is made up of computers that communicate with each other over a public network called the internet.  When you go to a web page like <a href= "www.google.com"> www.google.com</a>, an <b> HTTP </b> request is sent to a server.  The server retrieves the requested <b> HTML </b> document and sends it back to your computer to be interpreted by your web browser and displayed.

Most tags have two parts, and opening tag and a closing tag.  <b> Elements </b> refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags. </p> <p> <b> Inline and Block</b> </p> <p> HTML elements are displayed either as inline or block.  A <b> block </b> element breaks the content up vertically whereas an <b> inline</b> element flows within the content.
